                <p>Although I am a software developer graduate, I never really had a desk set up while studing at university. Hence why the machine that is powering this set up is a laptop. During my time at university, I did all of my work on my laptop only. I just found it convenient as I could just take it anywhere I wanted to go.</p>

                <p>The initial reason why I wanted to have own desk set up was so I could be productive and I could practice the skills I learnt at uni. My Macbook Air is also just 13 inch in size, so I wanted to have another monitor to look at to increase productivity. Lastly, I also got hooked into watching set up videos on YouTube.</p>

                <p>The machine that is powering this set up is a Macbook Air that came out in 2013. I love this laptop as it lightweight and the MAC OS is so much easier than Windows. I find that I am more productive with a MAC OS.</p>
