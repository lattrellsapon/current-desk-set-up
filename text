Although I am a software developer graduate, I never really had a desk set up while studing at university. Hence why the machine that is powering this set up is a laptop. During my time at university, I did all of my work on my laptop only. I just found it convenient as I could just take it anywhere I wanted to go.

The initial reason why I wanted to have own desk set up was so I could be productive and I could practice the skills I learnt at uni. My Macbook Air is also just 13 inch in size, so I wanted to have another monitor to look at to increase productivity. Lastly, I also got hooked into watching set up videos on YouTube.
